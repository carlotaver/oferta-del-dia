## 0. Installation and First Steps

### How to install Node

Since we are using [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/), we need to:

1. Install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

```
❯ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
```

2. Install [fish-nvm](https://github.com/FabioAntunes/fish-nvm)

```
❯ fisher add FabioAntunes/fish-nvm
```

3. Install [Node 8](https://nodejs.org/en/) with NVM

```
❯ nvm install 8
❯ node --version
v8.12.0
❯ nvm alias default 8.12.0
```

### How can I sync the project with a remote GitHub repository

```
❯ git remote add origin git@github.com:davidgchaves/oferta-del-dia.git
❯ git push -u origin master
```

## 1. Intro to React

- Everything in react is a component!
- A component is a reusable piece of code.
- Webpack is a bundler.

### How to declare a component

Both are equivalent

```jsx
class Dave extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>"What do you think you are doing, Dave?"</p>;
  }
}
```

```jsx
const Dave = () => {
  return <p>"What do you think you are doing, Dave?"</p>;
};
```
